| DONE | ZERO/fixed/CDI/Selic/savings, immutable chronological versions, archive/history, gross/net projection, estimated IR/IOF, comparison and per-currency totals |
| CALCULATION | Minor-unit strings; Decimal precision50, output-only rounding. Historical daily counterfactual composition; savings minimum real balance/complete anniversary. Future CURRENT_RATE, weekday-only BUSINESS_252, no complete holiday calendar |
| LIMITATIONS | Estimates are not confirmed gains/tax liability; no tax lots/come-cotas, FX, bank inference, paid source or scheduler. 10-year window,500 profiles/versions each,10000 movements/combined versions; explicit limits |
